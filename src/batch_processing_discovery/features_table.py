    #   batched activity as a single activity (not batched) if it is executed some times individually. In this way we could
    #   discover rules like "try to batch it but meanwhile the WT is not more than 1 day", so single activities could be fired
    #   not as part of a batch because the WT is 1 day.

    #   part of a batch, but the individual ones got fired because the firing rule was activated before accumulating more than
    #   1 instance.

    #   being activated. Thus, consider them without knowing if they were thought to be a batch could hinder the rules discovery.
